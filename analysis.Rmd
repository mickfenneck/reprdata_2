APPROPRIATE TITLE
========================================================

# Synopsis
Immediately after the title, there should be a synopsis which describes and summarizes your analysis in at most 10 complete sentences.

# Data Processing
describes (in words and code) how the data were loaded into R and processed for analysis. In particular, your analysis must start from the raw CSV file containing the data. You cannot do any preprocessing outside the document. If preprocessing is time-consuming you may consider using the cache = TRUE option for certain code chunks.
## raw csv file
Load the data and cache it.
```{r cache=TRUE}
data <- read.csv("repdata-data-StormData.csv")
```

## preprocessing
```{r}
str(data)
```
